title: About me

This is my personal blog. It is focused on tech tips & tricks and productivity. My mission is to help everyone work more productive with greater focus.

I write on computer technology tips and productivity. On occasion, I write about stuff that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into one of these categories.

My goal is to help computer and network administrators about their everyday work, create insightful, relevant content that you can put to work in your personal and professional life.
